    </div>
    <p>A Haunting insight into the mind of Lou Reed, originally a writer with his sights now set firmly on music. The Velvet Underground's sophomore album cemented their place as Art Rock pioneers. White Light White Heat builds upon their collaborative debut with Nico. John Cale's electonic violin, like the rest of the band, shows masterful technique while having more confidence when flirting with avant garde sensibilities.</p>
    <h4>2. Have a Nice Life - Deathconsciousness</h4>
    <img src="images/HaANi.jpg" alt="Deathconsciousness album cover"class="cover">
    <p>A true musical epic, at 85 minutes and incorporating ideas from a vast array of genres from shoegaze to ambient, Deathconsciousness is a rewarding listen for anyone willing. Although not intentional, the low sound quality of the album really adds to the atmosphere being created, losing the masters of this album may have been an unintentional stroke of genius.

    <h4>3. Radiohead - Amnesiac</h4>

    <p>Some would say Kid A's B-sides, but others including myself, believe it to be an improvement upon Kid A. Radiohead took risks on Kid A, Amnesiac's predecessor, and took even more on Amnesiac with the vast majority of those succesful. Radiohead's ability to branch into more unfamiliar terretories while keeping their broader appeal is as clear as ever, any album that can make a cohesive sound whilst going from industrial inspired IDM to pop sensibilities is a testement to the versatility of its' creator.</p>
    <h4>4. Danny Brown - Atrocity Exhibition</h4>
    <img src="images/AtrocityExhibition.jpg" alt="Atrocity Exhibition album cover." class="cover">
    <p>Danny Brown's unique voice and flow have always lent themself well to more experimental sounds, and on Atrocity Exhibition, we see Brown's most experimental outing to date. Every song on this album is a calculated risk, convention is abandoned in place of innovation and the result is an album that still sounds fresh after 100 listens. The album deals with difficult themes of drug addiction and mental illness, much like his previous albums, and the juxtaposition of his carefree sound with his introspective and dark lyrics really make the music special.</p>
    <h4>5. James Blake - James Blake</h4>
    <img src="images/James_Blake_Cover.jpg" alt="James Blake's self titled album cover." class="cover">
    <p>The soundtrack to being alone in the astral plane. James Blake's self titled debut mixes the skilled musicianship he picked up from his classical training with ideas from many genres including dream pop and IDM.</p>
